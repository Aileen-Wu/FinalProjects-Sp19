4.0,les raisons pourquoi donnerait un classement très positif sur ce restaurant est fort probablement à cause de la qualité des nouilles qui sont faites sur place derrière les vitres ainsi que pour le coût des plats étant très raisonnable pour les ramens les serveurs étaient très polis avec leurs clients ainsi que prenaient toute leur temps à nous servir et à attendre notre commande malgré les journées où le restaurant était bien rempli en bref question de service clientèle le seul hic fut les toilettes ainsi que le fait que les clients pouvaient se sentir très rapprochés des autres tables voisines malgré le fait que les nouilles compensent pour la situation
